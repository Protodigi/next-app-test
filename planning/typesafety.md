b# Type Safety Analysis and Improvement Plan

This document outlines files in the codebase that could benefit from enhanced TypeScript type safety. While the project uses TypeScript, several areas could be made more robust to prevent potential runtime errors and improve developer experience.

## Files Requiring Attention

### 1. `src/app/todos/page.tsx`

- **Issue:** The real-time subscription payload from Supabase is not strongly typed. The code uses `payload.new as Todo` and `payload.old as any`, which can lead to runtime errors if the payload shape changes.
- **Recommendation:** Define a specific type for the `PostgresChangePayload` from Supabase. This will provide type checking and autocompletion for the payload object, making the code safer and easier to maintain.

### 2. `src/app/signin/page.tsx`

- **Issue:** Error objects in `catch` blocks are typed as `any` (e.g., `catch (err: any)`). This bypasses type checking for error handling.
- **Recommendation:** Type errors as `unknown` and then perform type checks to narrow down the type before using it. At a minimum, you can check if it's an instance of `Error`. For Supabase errors, you can use the `isAuthApiError` or other type guards if available from the library.

### 3. `src/app/signup/page.tsx`

- **Issue:** Similar to the sign-in page, error objects in `catch` blocks are typed as `any`.
- **Recommendation:** Apply the same recommendation as for the sign-in page: type errors as `unknown` and perform type narrowing.

### 4. `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` & `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`

- **Issue:** The return types of the `getSupabaseBrowser` and `createServerClient` functions are inferred. While TypeScript's inference is powerful, explicit return types improve code clarity and can prevent unintentional changes to the public API of these modules.
- **Recommendation:** Explicitly define the return type of these functions as `SupabaseClient` from the `@supabase/supabase-js` package. This makes the function signatures clearer and more self-documenting.

## General Recommendations

- **Environment Variables:** The `src/types/env.d.ts` file correctly types the environment variables. However, consider using a runtime environment validation library like Zod to ensure that the required environment variables are present at runtime, not just compile time.
- **Component Props:** The UI components in `src/components/ui` are well-typed. Continue this pattern for all new components.
